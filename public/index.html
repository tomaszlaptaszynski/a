                Antiquity Now is a project in which I’m looking for traces of antique culture in Polish household.<br>
                <br>
                I’m interested in finding references in architecture and popular culture which are the result of contemporary interpretation of antiquity’s output. My inspiration is great Polish fantasy manifesting itself in diversity and originality of ideas, mainly in the field of area development. In my documentary I present the flood of buildings and objects bearing reference to antiquity but having a totally different function. It iis targeted at showing how they are interpreted in contemporary Poland in which for obvious reasons there is no monumental evidence of antique culture of Egypt, Greece and Rome, and exhibiting how we use their potential. I’d like to show that today, when antique culture knowledge is no longer the basis of our education or a door to a better life, we create objects detached from classical patterns which were reinterpreted for centuries and now have at their source memories from our holidays in Greece or films about Cleopatra.<br> 
                <br>
                I’m interested in „popantiquity”, roadside architecture, loose associations and whatever people in Poland remember, like, cultivate that comes from antiquity. Traditional antique culture is retreating and we are attacked by its twin sister transformed by popculture. It is the one which builds hotels shaped like pyramids or gives birth to Trojan horses standing by the roads. They are what I’m looking for. <br>

        <em>"Polish People's Republic (Communism) was gigantomania of blocks of flats and grey detached houses deproved of aesthetic spirit. Consequences of such situation were important and obvious - they destroyed people's aesthetic sense and bonds with the past. In this new reality I suggest to reach back to the past using beautiful architectural elements from different historical periods creating eclecticism. It will bring us closer to our ancestors and it will probably make us different from other citizens of European Union"</em><br>
